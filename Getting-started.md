This project front end was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Project Back-end is written in ExpressJS.

Data Storage: MongoDB. 
MongoDB was a choice due to its JSON-like storage mechanism and my familiarity with it.


This blog website provides a couple of functionality:
1. Get all blog posts
2. Posting a new blog post


Best practices to be added (in the future): 
1. In the future, there could be more test cases added.
2. Styling can be made better to ensure non-redundant styles.
3. Use hooks in React.
4. More re-factored code.
